This very important question could not be answered, until now. As of today, the music database is ready to use!

### Insights help us grow

In the current music streaming industry, personalized content and recommendations are key for continuous growth. 
Competition is fierce and improving every day, so our customers expect nothing less from us. In order to do that,
our analytics team needs to be able to answer the following questions:
- What music do we expect our users have an interest in, besides the music they are already listening to?
- How is our service used? 
    - What is the average session length of a typical user?
    - Are there seasonal differences in usage?
    - Is the listening behaviour different during the day compared to the evening?
- What artists do our users like, and is that different in comparison to typical hit lists? If so, how can we leverage
that?

With the new database, our analytics team has all the data they need to answer these important questions and more.

### The schema

### Example queries

- What are the differences in activity during the week? 

```sql
SELECT time.weekday
,    count(*) as n_songs_played
,    count(distinct sp.user_id) as n_unique_users
,    count(*) / count(distinct sp.user_id) as songs_per_user
,    count(*) / sum(count(*)) over () as perc_total_songs_played

FROM
    songplays as sp
    inner join time on time.start_time = sp.start_time
    
GROUP BY
    time.weekday
```

- Is there a difference in behaviour between paid and free users?

```sql
SELECT level
,    count(*) as n_songs_played
,    count(distinct user_id) as n_unique_users
,    count(*) / count(distinct user_id) as songs_per_user
,    count(*) / sum(count(*)) over () as perc_level

FROM
    songplays
    
GROUP BY
    level
```

- What is the gender distribution of our users, and are their differences in their activity?

```sql
SELECT users.gender
,    count(*) as n_songs_played
,    count(distinct sp.user_id) as n_unique_users
,    count(*) / sum(count(*)) over () as perc_songs_played

FROM
    songplays as sp
    inner join users on users.user_id = sp.user_id
    
GROUP BY
    users.gender
```

### Instructions

Before you can run the notebook and scripts, there are a few things you need to do:
- create and activate a virtual environment
- create a .env file and set your credentials

Furthermore, note that the logic needed to execute either the scripts or the notebook is stored in the /src folder.

#### create and activate a virtual environment 

You can either use Anaconda or venv to create the virtual environment. Regardless of your choice, you have to open
a (Anaconda) prompt, clone the project, and navigate to the project folder. Next, enter the following:

##### Anaconda
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate postgres
```

##### venv
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\Activate
```

#### create a .env file and set your credentials

Since this project needs to connect to a database, we need to store our credentials in a safe manner. To keep things
simple you can update the .env.example file, and remove .example from the filename. For more information about working
with secrets look [here](https://pybit.es/persistent-environment-variables.html).

### Start

It is recommended to start by looking at notebooks/main.ipynb. Once finished, you can execute the scripts in
a (Anaconda) prompt. Note that you must be in the top-level folder of the project with the virtual environment
activated. Also, the order of execution matters.

```bash
python scripts/create_tables.py
python scripts/etl.py
```
